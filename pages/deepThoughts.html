    <div class="text4">09/26/19 - Today I have finished formatting my webpage. I'm curious as to how I will use this page in the future. <br> 09/30/19 - Today I am going to try and get a good start on the about me secotion of my website, I hope it turns out well. <br> 10/01/19 - Today I have completely finished formatting my webpage. Now all that is left is to add to it throughout the year. <br> 10/02/19 - Today I am beinging to work on the lightning project. I have a few ideas on how to make it unique but I have to test them out. <br> 10/30/19 - Today is the day before holloween. I haven't been documenting on here recently but I thought today would be a good day to come back to it. I have finished both my lightning and dice projects and am happy to say that they are rather unique and cool. If you would like to see them just check out the projects page. <br> 10/31/19 - Today is Holloween and also the day in which we present our java projects to the class. I am going to show both my lightning and dice project, but not my website since the formatting is still aweful. By the time you are reading this though, it is hopefully better. <br> 11/08/19 - Today is Friday and all them studets in ISD 196 have the day off. It is 8 am however and I am still in here working on my code. I have finished the chemotaxis lab and am moving on to putting it into javascript. Depending on how I am feeling I may go on and get a head start on the star lab we are doing next week. <br> 11/11/19 - Today I have finished putting my chemotaxis lab into javascript and am quite happy with how it turned out. I can't move onto the star lab yet because the directions are not yet posted. That also means that I will have more time to finish formatting my website, and thank God for that.</div>

	In the story Miles had to deal with the constant fog, he didn’t like the constant fog but he had to learn to deal with it.  He also had to deal with the squatters, who stole their cabin.  Miles had to use his memory to try to remember the clues Mr. Kurt told him about where his cabin was.

	Miles is good at building and remembering things.  His skills in engineering  helped him build the Ali Princess, and his memory helped him remember the clues Mr. Kurt gave him about where his cabin was.

	Miles and his family were almost robbed on their way up to their cabin, and the squatters at their cabin gave them two guns so if anyone else tried to rob them they could defend themselves.  It was a good thing they had those guns because on their way up to Mr. Kurt’s cabin a group of robbers tried to rob them but they scared them away with their guns.

	If I had to live through what Miles had to live through I would be mad, scared, sad, and tired.  First, volcanic ash kept falling from the sky causing everybody to wear gas masks. Then, people in his neighborhood got robbed and shot forcing him and his family to move up to their cabin. On the way there people attempted to rob them, and finally when him and his family got up to their cabin they couldn’t live there because squatters had taken over their cabin.  They decided to try to find Mr. Kurt’s cabin, but on the way their they got stopped by robbers forcing them to shoot.  They finally ended up finding Mr. Kurt’s cabin and decided to live there.  If I would have gone through all that I would be mad, scared, sad, and tired all at the same time.
